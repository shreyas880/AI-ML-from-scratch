# AI-ML-from-scratch
Simple models to grasp the logical aspects of machine learning.

# Inspiration
This is a repository containing a few models that I tried to recreate in python from scratch.
I wanted to further my understanding on how machine learning worked and wanted to implement them in some way while reading the book "Stat Quest" by Josh Starmer.
It is a book that was recommended to me by a few of my peers and seniors to get started on ML due to its simplification of the logic making it quite easy to implement from scratch.

# Model information
These models were created using just the minimal libraries requried for any ML/data analysis project such as numpy, matplotlib etc.
They are by no means perfect or optimal but I have been able to get about a 90% accuracy with the datasets that I have tried.

# Future Goals
My next aim is to try and create a few more models that are more commonly used in practical applications such as K-means clustering, SVM's and Neural Networks (if possible).
Also want to learn their application in the field of chemistry which is a major contributor in my journey to learn about Machine Learning.
